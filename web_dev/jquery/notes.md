# jQuery!

This is my plan for learning jQuery for the next lil' bit:

* I have two hours.
* I'll spend at least 45 minutes Googling jQuery tutorials and maybe watching videos and reading up on the subject
* Take a break!
* I'll spend about ten minutes planning out a project for a way to test different jQuery concepts I've learned
* Spend 45 minutes building, tinkering, building up and breaking down

## After times is up...

I found that the best methods are not only to read tutorials, but play with the examples provided on your own. I found that W3 Schools is a great resource for quick, easy to understand tutorials. I also found it beneficial not to get bogged down with the details. Reading a tutorial of any new type of scripting language or skillset is like trying to read the dictionary. It's more useful to give everything a brief overview, think, "Okay, I now know how to do [x], so I can remember where to find that later if I need it." I found taking a break to be useful, and taking a walk between heavy topics to be of use as well.
