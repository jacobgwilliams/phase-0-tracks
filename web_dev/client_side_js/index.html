      <p>This is my page dedicated to marbles. Though they may just seem like little glass orbs, they are filled with magic and sometimes have awesome little designs in them.</p>

      <h2>Why marbles?</h2>
      <p>Marbles used to be the currency of magicians, children, and other marbles. It's true! The reason this page exists is to honor the memory of marbles and try to encourage the world to just use marbles as currency instead of that silly paper money.</p>

      <h2>Carl Fisher Marbles</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.carlfishermarbles.com/">Click here</a> to go to Carl Fisher Marbles, a page dedicated to contemporary clay marbles. I like the way this page is designed because, though some of the images and color and font choices are icky, I like the layout - the nav bar is clean and to the left, there is a clean divison of content, the header, and footer sections. However, upon further examination of the source code, I don't quite agree with the way it's built. It could use more block level, semantic elements instead of various other elements. For instance, the navigation to the left is created with a table with one column. That is one way to design your nav bar, but it isn't even nested in the "nav" element, which could easily be used in CSS to organize and stylize it. There are no header or footer elements either, they are noted in the HTML with comments.</p>
