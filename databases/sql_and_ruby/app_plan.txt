It would be cool to make a pokemon style game that is super basic.
Maybe an RPG that involves cleaning up your house.
A text-based adventure where the goal is to find all of your school supplies. Maybe it could randomly generate things to pick up or the places in which they exist.

It could also just be an app for where you put important things. An app that saves and stores the locations of various items you are always nervous about losing.
