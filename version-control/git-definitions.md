# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method of making multiple versions of a project by branching off of a master branch, then merging changes back into the master. This is useful because it helps workflow when working as a team and different team members are able to work on seperate items without running the risk of overwriting one another's work, and it also helps to be able to check back through the progress of a project to see what changes have been made where and by whom, in the event that a bug pops up or the rest of your team just needs to know what changes have occurred.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a seperate version of a project, that can be used a save point that can be referred back to at any given time. It is important to do work on seperate branches and then merge them back into the master file so as to not overwrite someone's and to be able to keep track of changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit does just that - it commits and records updates to the git repository. We always include meaningful messages with each commit that are specific and, as a rule of thumb, would be understandable to someone new coming into the project to be able to understand exactly what changes have occurred. Vague commit messages aren't terribly useful.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches you want to merge have diverged, for instance, you and another programmer edited the same line of code differently in the same file, and are trying to merge them together. Git responds with an error message and it's up to the programmer to resolve the conflict before merging. This is prevented by always pulling from the latest commit.
