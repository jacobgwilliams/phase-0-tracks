Elevator Robot:

- Robot enters elevator
- Assuming robot has some integer input (the floor number "floornum")
  - Robot hand starts hovering at Floor 1 button (bottom left)
  - Counter = 1
  - Until counter == floornum
    - Robot moves hand right to the next button.
    - Increment counter (starting at 1) += 1 for every button traversed.
    - If robot hits end of row before counter == floornum:
      - Move up one row, hover back number of spaces moved to begin with
        # Unsure how elevators work, but assuming numbers increase left to right, then up a row, left to right again, etc.
      - Continue counting buttons
    - When counter == floornum
      - Press button
      - DING!
