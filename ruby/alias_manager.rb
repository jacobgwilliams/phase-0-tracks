# PSEUDOCODE:
# Take a real name
## Get input from user, request a first and last name.
## Split into an array
# Swap first and last name
## Reverse contents of above array
# Change each vowel to the next vowel in the sequence 'aeiou'
## Iterate to cycle through every vowel and change it to next in sequence
# Change all consonants to next consonant in alphabet 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'
## Iterate to cycle throuh every consonant and change it to next in sequence
# Handle edge cases ('z')
# Deal with upper case letters, perhaps by making everything lower case first, then going up case on the first letter of each word in the joined string.
